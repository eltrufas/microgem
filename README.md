# gemserve

`gemserve` is a small libevent based gemini server. It is currently unfinished
but I project it will reach a usable state within the next decade.


## Current capabilities
It serves a single static file. That's it for now. I'm using it to serve my
gemsite at [gemini://trfs.me/](gemini://trfs.me/).


## Planned out
The idea is to reach a point where I can have a tiny binary that I can point to
a directory of `text/gemini` documents and have them served. No ambitions
beyond that.

Immediate TODOS:
* URI parsing
* Routing


## Contributing

I'm accepting contributions in the forms of comments, advice, code reviews
(it's my first c project), or even code patches if you're feeling super
generous at my personal email: [rafael@trfs.me](mailto:rafael@trfs.me).
